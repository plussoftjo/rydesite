With safety and security as its key pillar, the Company does not condone any form of violence or aggression. Drivers must not exhibit aggressive behavior, including getting into verbal disputes with passengers, using vulgarity or insinuation or making threats or physical blows with the passenger. In the event of the situation getting out of hand, never take matters into your own hands or escalate the tension (i.e. harass or make threats whether the ride is ongoing or has ended). Always choose to report the case to the Company as soon as possible. We aim to serve all parties impartially and will take such actions as appropriate.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(i).</strong>&nbsp;You are strictly forbidden from committing any form of sexual offence, including making lewd comments/ texts, sexual harassment, unwanted physical contact, unlawful restraint, drugging, molestation and rape. These are criminal offences under the law and a serious violation of the Company&rsquo;s safety policy. Offenders will be prosecuted against the law. For better understanding, training materials regarding sexual harassment is available to better understand what is not permissible.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(j).</strong>&nbsp;Bear in mind that harassment differs according to societal and personal norms &mdash; commenting on appearance, asking overly personal questions and infringing into personal space are generally deemed inappropriate.

Do inform your passengers if you are running late.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(o).</strong>&nbsp;In the event your passenger leaves behind his/her belongings (including cash) in your vehicle, you are required to:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>notify the Company within 4 hours of discovery; and</li>\r\n<li>return the same to the passenger concerned or to the Company within 48 hours of discovery.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>(p).</strong>&nbsp;Honour a booking you have accepted. You are also advised to press &lsquo;pick-up&rsquo; and &lsquo;drop-off&rsquo; button only when the passenger is on board and when the passenger has alighted from your car respectively. You are strongly encouraged not to cancel jobs except in an emergency (e.g. car breakdown, involved in an accident)</p>\r\n<p><strong>(q).</strong>&nbsp;Do not transfer a job to other drivers or any other person. If you are unable to pick up a passenger due to an emergency, please inform the passenger immediately before cancelling the booking.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(r).</strong>&nbsp;Wait for your passenger to arrive at the pick-up point.

Collect the correct fixed fare / meter fare accordingly plus other charges such as toll &amp; surcharge.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(t).</strong>&nbsp;Do not solicit passengers to make personal or extra booking arrangements. This goes against our principle of assigning the nearest vehicle to the passenger. You are also depriving your passenger from getting a vehicle in the most efficient way.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(u).</strong>&nbsp;Do not recommend other ride booking apps to your passengers. This practice is annoying and unprofessional to passengers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(v).</strong>&nbsp;Passengers do appreciate honesty on the part of drivers.

Do not disclose or share any of your passenger&rsquo;s personal information with anyone, whether your friends or family members, or other passengers, drivers or members of the public through any channel or platform.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(z).</strong>&nbsp;You shall not ask passengers to change payment method after accepting a job (Eg: Asking passengers to pay by cash instead of credit card)</p>\r\n<p><strong>(aa).</strong>&nbsp;You must only use the vehicle that corresponds to the vehicle description which has been provided by you to the Company for provision of the transportation services. Do not take bookings if your car plate number differs from the number registered on the app.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(bb).</strong>&nbsp;Minimum credit wallet top up amount via all channels (bank transfer, M1 billing, transfer from cash wallet, etc) is $10. Any actions of manipulating the assignment system will be deemed an abuse of the system and may result in your access being terminated.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(cc).</strong>&nbsp;Drivers are expected to achieve minimum performance levels on Acceptance Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Driver Ratings in order to receive bookings on the RydeCar platform.

You are not allowed to install inward facing video camera that invade into the privacy of passengers.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(ee).</strong>&nbsp;The Company maintains a zero-tolerance policy regarding all infringements and violations of this Code of Conduct and the Driver acknowledges that this may result in suspension or termination of user access to the Ryde platform.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(ff).</strong>&nbsp;No-refund policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate your usage, our decision to terminate or suspend your usage, disruption caused to the Service either planned, accidental or intentional, or any reason whatsoever.</p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li><strong> EMERGENCY PROCEDURE</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>(a).</strong>&nbsp;When you are faced with a situation that requires immediate emergency attention, please call, 104, 122, 115. Once all parties are safe and the situation has been handled by the authorities, please then notify the Company promptly so we may assist and take appropriate action as needed, including cooperating with law enforcement.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(b).</strong>&nbsp;You are required to refer to the Standard Operating Procedure on Emergency for further information.</p>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n<li><strong> CONTINUING TRAINING AND IMPROVEMENT</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>(a).</strong>&nbsp;At the Company, we are committed to continual improvement to service standards.

We also enforce continual evaluation of a driver&rsquo;s suitability and performance, and provide feedback accordingly. In most cases, we aim to work together with the driver via feedback sessions, training events, workshops and audits etc. Results from these efforts depend on receptivity of the driver.</p>\r\n<p><strong>(c).</strong>&nbsp;You are required to attend the training sessions that are arranged by the Company or its agents unless you are faced with an emergency or due to other unavoidable reasons.

RydeLite is a basic version of the Application which allows you to continue to make bookings during a downtime. In the event of a downtime, the Application will automatically switch to the RydeLite version without any action on your part. Being a basic version, RydeLite will have some differences in its features and application compared to the Application. The following are the differences that you should be aware of:-</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><u>Only RydeCar</u>. Under RydeLite, only Rydecar will be available for booking.</li>\r\n<li><u>Fixed Fares</u>. A ride booked via RydeLite shall have fixed fare only irrespective of the type of transport / vehicles. The fixed fare will be shown on the RydeLite Application after you have keyed in your location and destination.</li>\r\n<li><u>Cash Payment Only</u>. As a stripped-down version of the Application, rides made via RydeLite shall be paid by cash only. RydeLite is unable to accept payments by RydePay credits and credit cards. By continuing with the booking, you hereby acknowledge and agree that you accept the fixed fare.</li>\r\n<li><u>Manual Key-In</u>. You are required to manually key-in your pick-up location and destination.</li>\r\n<li><u>Number Masking</u>. Under RydeLite, there will be no number masking. This means that your number will be available to the Service Providers. By continuing to confirm the booking, you hereby acknowledge that you understand and agree to this condition.</li>\r\n<li><u>No RydeRewards Points</u>. Any ride booked via RydeLite will not be entitled to any RydeRewards Points.</li>\r\n<li><u>No Chat Function</u>. The chat function in RydeLite will be disabled. Therefore, the only means of communication with the Service Providers will need to be conducted via calls.</li>\r\n<li><u>Other Stripped Down Functionalities</u>. As a stripped-down version of the Application, RydeLite will not show the estimated time of arrival of your booking. Any promos that are running when RydeLite is activated will not be eligible to be used and you will not be able to tag your ride as &lsquo;Business ride&rsquo;.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n<li>Ratings By Third Party Transportation Providers</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The third party transportation providers have the right to rate you as a user of the Service or a user for whom you book the Service.
