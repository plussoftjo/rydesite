We strive to be Southeast Asia&rsquo;s safest and most trusted platform for all our users.</p>\r\n<p>Our passengers ride with us because they trust that we can provide them with safe and convenient transportation. Our drivers partner with us because they trust that we have their interests at heart. Trust is the foundation to this ongoing relationship that allows us to drive Southeast Asia forward.</p>\r\n<p>As such, we expect&nbsp;<strong>all users</strong>&nbsp;on our platform to behave appropriately and respect each other&rsquo;s boundaries. Do note that any form of physical contact or even compliments on his/her looks can been seen as sexual harassment.</p>\r\n<p>Inappropriate behaviour has no place on our platform and we have a ZERO TOLERANCE policy on sexual harassment. We must always treat each other with courtesy and avoid all forms of disrespect or harassment.</p>\r\n<h3><strong>What constitutes sexual harassment?</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Sexual harassment is a criminal offence. It may be in any form of verbal or physical act of a sexual nature, including but not limited to:</p>\r\n<p>(i) Suggestive comments or jokes;</p>\r\n<p>(ii) Continuous personal advances or invitations;</p>\r\n<p>(iii) Requests for sexual favours;</p>\r\n<p>(iv) Unnecessary physical contact;</p>\r\n<p>(vi) Spreading or displaying images with apparent sexual content, etc.</p>\r\n<h3>How does Ryde take action?</h3>\r\n<p>Ryde will take action against users who do not abide by these rules and this includes suspension from our App. In addition, Ryde will work with the authorities to investigate and seek support for the victims.</p>\r\n<h3>Five simple rules to be mindful of when using our platform.</h3>\r\n<p>To prevent miscommunication, we encourage all users to be mindful of one another&rsquo;s privacy and personal space. When in doubt, we recommend that they do the following:</p>\r\n<p>#1&nbsp;<strong>The Golden Rule</strong>: NO physical contact.</p>\r\n<p>#2&nbsp;<strong>Be respectful.</strong>&nbsp;Respect each other. Never use vulgarities, abusive language or suggestive and lewd remarks in speech or text.</p>\r\n<p>#3&nbsp;<strong>Respect privacy.</strong>&nbsp;Do not post or share any driver or passenger information on any platform.</p>\r\n<p>#4&nbsp;<strong>All booking information are confidential</strong>. Do not abuse this information or contact each other after the ride has been completed.</p>\r\n<p>#5&nbsp;<strong>Avoid causing unnecessary alarm</strong>. All drivers and passengers are advised to stick to the GPS recommended route, unless it is mutually agreed otherwise. This helps prevent any misunderstanding between drivers and passengers.</p>\r\n<p>We believe that everyone has a part to play in preventing sexual harassment. If you do encounter such inappropriate behaviour, do report it to the authorities in a timely manner. We will do everything we can to support official investigations of any criminal intent or act, in accordance with the law, and prevent &nbsp;its reoccurrence.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Last updated on July&nbsp;14, 2019.

In the event of a downtime, the Application will automatically switch to the RydeLite version without any action on your part. Being a basic version, RydeLite will have some differences in its features and application compared to the Application. The following are the differences that you should be aware of:-</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><u>Only RydeCar</u>. Under RydeLite, only Rydecar will be available for booking.</li>\r\n<li><u>Fixed Fares</u>. A ride booked via RydeLite shall have fixed fare only irrespective of the type of transport / vehicles. The fixed fare will be shown on the RydeLite Application after you have keyed in your location and destination.</li>\r\n<li><u>Cash Payment Only</u>. As a stripped-down version of the Application, rides made via RydeLite shall be paid by cash only. RydeLite is unable to accept payments by RydePay credits and credit cards. By continuing with the booking, you hereby acknowledge and agree that you accept the fixed fare.</li>\r\n<li><u>Manual Key-In</u>. You are required to manually key-in your pick-up location and destination.</li>\r\n<li><u>Number Masking</u>. Under RydeLite, there will be no number masking. This means that your number will be available to the Service Providers. By continuing to confirm the booking, you hereby acknowledge that you understand and agree to this condition.</li>\r\n<li><u>No RydeRewards Points</u>. Any ride booked via RydeLite will not be entitled to any RydeRewards Points.</li>\r\n<li><u>No Chat Function</u>. The chat function in RydeLite will be disabled. Therefore, the only means of communication with the Service Providers will need to be conducted via calls.</li>\r\n<li><u>Other Stripped Down Functionalities</u>. As a stripped-down version of the Application, RydeLite will not show the estimated time of arrival of your booking. Any promos that are running when RydeLite is activated will not be eligible to be used and you will not be able to tag your ride as &lsquo;Business ride&rsquo;.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n<li>Ratings By Third Party Transportation Providers</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>The third party transportation providers have the right to rate you as a user of the Service or a user for whom you book the Service.
