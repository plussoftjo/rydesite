The collection, use and disclosure of any such Personal Data is not  conducted on behalf of the Company. As such, it is your sole responsibility to comply with local privacy laws and  regulations, and you should obtain the consent of your passenger prior to using the personal in-vehicle cameras in  such vehicles. Personal Data is defined in ryde&rsquo;s Privacy Policy which can be viewed here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(f).

(with effect from 1st July 2019, it will be increased to 4.5)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(b). If a passenger believes a driver may be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, he or she has the right to end the trip  immediately and alert ryde 24hrs Call Centre or email through our online Helpdesk Centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Company does not tolerate any consumption of drugs or alcohol by drivers while using the ryde platform.

You are prohibited from having controlled items or keeping weapons of any kind or description in your vehicle or on your person  for any reason whatsoever. (c). You shall not refuse to provide services based on a person&rsquo;s race, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation, sex, marital status, gender identity, age or any other characteristic protected under law. This type of behavior can result in  termination of user access to the ryde platform. It is disrespectful to make derogatory or discriminatory remarks about a person  or group whether or not the passenger belongs to the group. (d) The Company takes a serious view on reckless driving which endangers  passengers and/or other road users and this includes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driving against the direction of traffic Failure to comply with the speed limit Failure to conform with traffic light Using your mobile phone without any hands free kit while driving Failure to use the indicator signal prior to changing lanes or turning into a junction Breaches of any other traffic laws (e).

You are to always ensure that your passengers wear a seatbelt while riding in your vehicle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(h). Avoid violent and aggressive behaviour at all times. With safety and security as its key pillar, the Company does not condone  any form of violence or aggression. Drivers must not exhibit aggressive behavior, including getting into verbal disputes with passengers,  using vulgarity or insinuation or making threats or physical blows with the passenger. In the event of the situation getting out of hand,  never take matters into your own hands or escalate the tension (i.e. harass or make threats whether the ride is ongoing or has ended).  Always choose to report the case to the Company as soon as possible. We aim to serve all parties impartially and will take such actions  as appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(i). You are strictly forbidden from committing any form of sexual offence, including making lewd comments/ texts, sexual harassment,  unwanted physical contact, unlawful restraint, drugging, molestation and rape. These are criminal offences under the law and a serious  violation of the Company&rsquo;s safety policy. Offenders will be prosecuted against the law. For better understanding, training materials  regarding sexual harassment is available to better understand what is not permissible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(j). Bear in mind that harassment differs according to societal and personal norms &mdash; commenting on appearance, asking overly personal  questions and infringing into personal space are generally deemed inappropriate. We urge you to be mindful of other users&rsquo; privacy and  personal space.

Do inform your passengers if you are running late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(o). In the event your passenger leaves behind his/her belongings (including cash) in your vehicle, you are required to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>notify the Company within 4 hours of discovery; and return the same to the passenger concerned or to the Company within 48 hours of discovery. (p). Honour a booking you have accepted. You are also advised to press &lsquo;pick-up&rsquo; and &lsquo;drop-off&rsquo; button only when the passenger is on board and  when the passenger has alighted from your car respectively. You are strongly encouraged not to cancel jobs except in an emergency (e.g. car  breakdown, involved in an accident)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(q). Do not transfer a job to other drivers or any other person. If you are unable to pick up a passenger due to an emergency, please inform the passenger  immediately before cancelling the booking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(r). Wait for your passenger to arrive at the pick-up point. Driving off without waiting for them provides a very negative experience for your customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(s). Do not set your own fares as this may be considered as overcharging. Collect the correct fixed fare / meter fare accordingly plus other charges such as toll &amp;  surcharge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(t). Do not solicit passengers to make personal or extra booking arrangements. This goes against our principle of assigning the nearest vehicle to the passenger.  You are also depriving your passenger from getting a vehicle in the most efficient way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(u). Do not recommend other ride booking apps to your passengers. This practice is annoying and unprofessional to passengers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(v). Passengers do appreciate honesty on the part of drivers. Hence, you shall provide your service that is based on this principle. Acts of cheating such as failing  to give correct change for cash payment or taking a longer route than necessary (unless there is a valid reason for it or specifically requested by the passenger)  is prohibited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(w). You are strictly prohibited from contacting your passenger through any channel or platforms unless it is for purposes related to the job booking made by such  passenger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(x).

You MUST keep confidential all your passenger&rsquo;s personal information (i.e. name, mobile number and address) that comes into  your possession. Do not disclose or share any of your passenger&rsquo;s personal information with anyone, whether your friends or family members, or other passengers,  drivers or members of the public through any channel or platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(z). You shall not ask passengers to change payment method after accepting a job (Eg: Asking passengers to pay by cash instead of credit card)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(aa). You must only use the vehicle that corresponds to the vehicle description which has been provided by you to the Company for provision of the transportation  services. Do not take bookings if your car plate number differs from the number registered on the app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(bb). Minimum credit wallet top up amount via all channels (bank transfer, M1 billing, transfer from cash wallet, etc) is $10. Any actions of manipulating the  assignment system will be deemed an abuse of the system and may result in your access being terminated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(cc). Drivers are expected to achieve minimum performance levels on Acceptance Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Driver Ratings in order to receive bookings on the  rydeCar platform. Acceptance Rate cannot fall below 30%. Cancellation Rate cannot exceed 15%. Driver Ratings cannot fall below 4.3 (with effect from 1st July  2019, it will be increased to 4.5)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(dd). You shall maintain a proper working condition, clean and smoke-free LTA-compliant transportation at all times. You are not allowed to install inward facing video  camera that invade into the privacy of passengers. Installing inward camera without LTA approval is an offence.

No-refund policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate your usage, our decision to terminate or suspend your usage, disruption caused  to the Service either planned, accidental or intentional, or any reason whatsoever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. EMERGENCY PROCEDURE (a). When you are faced with a situation that requires immediate emergency attention, please call 999/995.

The Company implements a two-way passenger and driver feedback system, as well as a mystery passenger audit system. We also enforce continual evaluation  of a driver&rsquo;s suitability and performance, and provide feedback accordingly. In most cases, we aim to work together with the driver via feedback sessions, training  events, workshops and audits etc. Results from these efforts depend on receptivity of the driver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(c). You are required to attend the training sessions that are arranged by the Company or its agents unless you are faced with an emergency or due to other  unavoidable reasons.
